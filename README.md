# The-Game-of-Life

###The application of the game:

First, you will see a welcome sentence of the game.

Then, the game will ask you to define the size of the world, including the row and the column of the world.

After this, you can choose to randomly initialize the world or click the cell in the map to initialize the world.

After initializing, the system will ask you if you want to define the step of the game. If yes, you can then enter the step number. If no, the game will run until you press "ESC".

And during the program, the system will ask you if you want to run the game according to the delay randomly form in the initial file or press "DOWN" and "RIGHT" to continue the game.
